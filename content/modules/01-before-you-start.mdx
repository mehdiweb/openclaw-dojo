# Before You Start

## What Is OpenClaw Really?

Let's clear up the confusion:

- **OpenClaw** = The gateway software (connects chat apps to AI)
- **Pi** = The AI agent that actually responds (you'll configure this)
- **Clawd** = Our friendly lobster mascot 🦞

OpenClaw is a bridge. It lets you talk to AI agents (like Pi) through WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, or iMessage.

## What You'll Need

Before we start, make sure you have:

### Required:
1. **A VPS or always-on computer** ($6-20/month)
   - DigitalOcean, Hetzner, AWS, or any cloud provider
   - Your laptop won't work (needs to be always on)
   
2. **Node.js version 22 or higher**
   - Check: `node --version`
   - Install: https://nodejs.org
   
3. **Basic terminal comfort**
   - Copy-pasting commands
   - Editing text files
   - SSH into servers

4. **Time: 2-4 hours**
   - First setup takes time
   - Future updates are faster

### For WhatsApp:
- A **separate phone number** (recommended)
  - Your personal number works but isn't ideal
  - Cheap options: Hetzner eSIM, giffgaff, any prepaid SIM
  
### For Telegram:
- A Telegram account
- 5 minutes with @BotFather

### API Keys (for AI):
- Anthropic API key (Claude) - https://console.anthropic.com
- OR OpenAI API key - https://platform.openai.com
- Budget: $5-20/month depending on usage

## ⚠️ Important Warnings

**DON'T use Bun:** WhatsApp and Telegram have known issues with Bun runtime. Use Node.js.

**This isn't "no-code":** You'll edit config files and run terminal commands. If that scares you, consider hiring professional installation help instead.

**First-time setup is hard:** It gets easier after the first one. That's why I made this guide.

## Check Your Readiness

Before continuing, confirm:
- [ ] You have a VPS or spare computer that stays on
- [ ] Node.js ≥22 is installed (or you know how to install it)
- [ ] You're comfortable with basic terminal commands
- [ ] You have $10-30 for API credits this month

**If you checked all boxes:** Continue to Module 2  
**If not:** Get those ready first, or hire professional help
