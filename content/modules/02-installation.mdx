# Installation

There are two ways to install. I recommend Option 1.

## Option 1: Official Installer (Recommended)

This is the fastest, most reliable method:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.bot/install.sh | bash
```

**What this does:**
- Downloads OpenClaw CLI
- Installs it globally
- Sets up basic directories

## Option 2: npm Install (Alternative)

If you prefer npm:

```bash
npm install -g openclaw@latest
```

**Or with pnpm:**
```bash
pnpm add -g openclaw@latest
```

## Verify Installation

Check that it worked:

```bash
openclaw --version
```

You should see something like: `openclaw/2.4.0`

## Common Installation Errors

### Error: "command not found"
- Fix: Close and reopen your terminal
- Or run: `source ~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc`)

### Error: "permission denied"
- Fix: You might need `sudo` for the installer
- Or use the npm method instead

### Error: "node version too old"
- Fix: Update Node.js to version 22+
- Check: `node --version`

## Next Step

Once installed, we need to configure it. Continue to Module 3.
