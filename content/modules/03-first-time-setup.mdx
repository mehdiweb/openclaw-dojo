# First-Time Setup

OpenClaw has a built-in wizard that walks you through initial setup. This is the easiest way to configure everything.

## Start the Wizard

```bash
openclaw onboard --install-daemon
```

**What the wizard does:**
1. Sets up authentication (API keys)
2. Configures gateway settings
3. Sets up communication channels
4. Installs background service (so it stays running)
5. Creates your workspace

## What You'll Configure

### Step 1: Local vs Remote Gateway
- **Local:** Running on this machine (what we're doing)
- **Remote:** Running on another server

Choose: **Local**

### Step 2: Authentication (Choose One)

**Option A: Anthropic API Key (Recommended)**
- Get one: https://console.anthropic.com
- Cost: ~$5-15/month for light use
- Best performance for coding tasks

**Option B: OpenAI API Key**
- Get one: https://platform.openai.com
- Cost: ~$5-20/month
- Good alternative

**Option C: OAuth (if you have Claude Code)**
- Reuse existing Claude credentials
- Run: `claude setup-token` first

Enter your API key when prompted. The wizard stores it securely.

### Step 3: Gateway Token (Security)

The wizard generates a token automatically. **Save this somewhere safe.**

You'll need it to access the web dashboard remotely.

### Step 4: Background Service

The wizard asks about installing a service. Say **YES**.

This means OpenClaw will:
- Start automatically when your server boots
- Restart if it crashes
- Run in the background (no need to keep terminal open)

## What Gets Installed

After the wizard completes, you have:

```
~/.openclaw/
├── openclaw.json          # Main config
├── credentials/           # API keys and auth
├── workspace/            # Your AI workspace
└── logs/                 # Log files
```

## Verify the Gateway is Running

```bash
openclaw gateway status
```

Should show: `running`

If not:
```bash
openclaw gateway
```

## Access the Dashboard

Open your browser:
```
http://127.0.0.1:18789/
```

If you see the Control UI, you're good! If it asks for a token, paste the one from the wizard.

## Common Wizard Errors

**"No auth configured"**
- You skipped the API key step
- Re-run: `openclaw onboard`

**"Gateway already running"**
- It's already working!
- Check: `openclaw status`

**"Permission denied" (service install)**
- Normal on some systems
- The wizard will give you manual instructions
