# Connect WhatsApp

**⚠️ Requirements:**
- A phone number that can receive SMS
- WhatsApp app on your phone
- 10-15 minutes

**Recommended:** Use a separate number, not your personal WhatsApp.

## Step 1: Configure Access Control (IMPORTANT)

Before connecting WhatsApp, you MUST tell OpenClaw who can message you. Otherwise, anyone could message your bot.

Edit the config file:

```bash
nano ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json
```

Add this section:

```json
{
  "channels": {
    "whatsapp": {
      "dmPolicy": "allowlist",
      "allowFrom": ["+15551234567"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Format:** Use international format with + and country code.

**Save:** Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter

## Step 2: Get a Phone Number

You need a real mobile number. WhatsApp blocks most VoIP/virtual numbers.

**Good options:**
- Local prepaid SIM (any carrier)
- eSIM: Hetzner (EU), giffgaff (UK), etc.
- Spare/old phone with active SIM

**Avoid:** Google Voice, TextNow, most "free SMS" services

The number only needs to receive **one SMS** for verification. After that, WhatsApp Web sessions persist.

## Step 3: Start WhatsApp Web Login

```bash
openclaw channels login
```

You'll see a QR code in the terminal.

## Step 4: Scan the QR Code

On your phone:
1. Open WhatsApp
2. Settings → Linked Devices → Link a Device
3. Point camera at the QR code in your terminal
4. Wait for "Linked" confirmation

## Step 5: Test It

Send a message to yourself (WhatsApp "Message yourself" feature).

**If you get a reply:** 🎉 Success!

**If nothing happens:** Check the next section.

## Troubleshooting

### "Not linked" error
```bash
openclaw channels status
```
Shows `linked: false`

**Fix:** QR expired. Run `openclaw channels login` again.

### "Pairing code required"

This is normal for first contact! OpenClaw uses "pairing" for security.

Check for the code:
```bash
openclaw pairing list whatsapp
```

You'll see something like:
```
whatsapp: ABC123 (expires in 45 min)
```

Approve it:
```bash
openclaw pairing approve whatsapp ABC123
```

Now try messaging again.

### No response at all

Check logs:
```bash
openclaw logs --follow
```

Look for errors.

Common issues:
- **Wrong number format** → Use +15551234567 format
- **Not in allowlist** → Check your config
- **Gateway not running** → `openclaw gateway status`

### Bun runtime error

**CRITICAL:** If you're using Bun, switch to Node.js:

```bash
# Check which runtime
which node

# Make sure gateway uses Node
openclaw gateway --verbose
```

WhatsApp has known issues with Bun. Use Node.js.

## Using Your Personal Number (Not Recommended)

If you MUST use your personal WhatsApp:

1. Enable self-chat mode in config:
```json
{
  "channels": {
    "whatsapp": {
      "selfChatMode": true,
      "dmPolicy": "allowlist",
      "allowFrom": ["+15551234567"]
    }
  }
}
```

2. Use "Message yourself" to avoid spamming contacts

## Next Step

WhatsApp is connected! You can add Telegram too (Module 5), or skip to testing your setup (Module 6).
