# Testing Your Setup

Before using your AI daily, let's run through verification checks.

## Check 1: Gateway Status

```bash
openclaw status
```

Should show:
- Gateway: running
- WhatsApp: linked (if you set it up)
- Telegram: connected (if you set it up)

## Check 2: Health Check

```bash
openclaw health
```

This pings the running gateway. Should return "healthy" or green checkmarks.

If not, check: `openclaw logs --follow`

## Check 3: Security Audit

```bash
openclaw security audit --deep
```

This checks for common security issues. Review any warnings.

## Check 4: Send Test Message

Send a test via CLI:

```bash
openclaw message send --target +15551234567 --message "Hello from OpenClaw"
```

Replace with your actual phone number.

**Should:** Send a WhatsApp message to yourself.

## Check 5: Dashboard Access

Open browser:
```
http://127.0.0.1:18789/
```

**If you see:** Control UI with chat interface → ✅ Working

**If you see:** Token request → Paste your gateway token (from onboarding)

**If you see:** Nothing/Error → Check gateway is running

## Check 6: AI Response Test

Send a message to your bot (via WhatsApp or Telegram):

Try: "Hello, can you help me with something?"

**Expected:** AI responds within 10-30 seconds

**If no response:**
1. Check `openclaw logs --follow` for errors
2. Verify API key is valid (check Anthropic/OpenAI dashboard)
3. Make sure you have API credits remaining

## Check 7: Check API Credits

Make sure you have funds:

- **Anthropic:** https://console.anthropic.com/settings/billing
- **OpenAI:** https://platform.openai.com/usage

If balance is $0, add a payment method.

## Common "Not Working" Issues

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| No AI response | No API credits | Add payment to Anthropic/OpenAI |
| "No auth" error | API key not set | Re-run `openclaw onboard` |
| Gateway not running | Service stopped | `openclaw gateway` or restart service |
| Can't access dashboard | Wrong URL | Use `http://127.0.0.1:18789/` |
| WhatsApp not linked | QR expired | `openclaw channels login` again |
| Telegram not responding | Wrong token | Check config, restart gateway |

## Performance Expectations

**Normal response time:** 5-30 seconds depending on:
- Complexity of your question
- Current API load
- Your internet connection

**If consistently slow (>60 seconds):**
- Check your VPS specs (2GB RAM minimum recommended)
- Consider upgrading your server
- Check `openclaw logs` for timeouts

## You're Ready!
